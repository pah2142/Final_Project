## Final Project Proposal: Is Tidal Stress Triggering Earthquakes Near Hilo?

I will be testing tidal triggering of Earthquakes near Hilo, Hawaii, to see if I can identify a tidally triggered component of Earthquake occurrence. I will use tide data from the Hilo, Hawaii tidal gauge data station from UH Manoa's School of Earth Science and Technology (SOEST) (https://uhslc.soest.hawaii.edu/network/), and I will use the earthquake data attainable from the USGS from (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/search/). I will probably analyze a period of around a year, producing a map of all the Earthquakes that occur on the big island of Hawaii during my study period. I will conduct a binomial test to determine whether earthquakes occurred during the low-tide half cycle at a statistically significant rate.
